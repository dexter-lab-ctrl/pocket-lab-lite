Only source-implemented behavior is listed; live server-phone qualification remains separate.

- Passkeys/WebAuthn and OIDC federation are not enabled; Pocket Lab Lite remains self-contained with the local owner flow.
- Rules currently protects the explicitly registered `catalog.install` and `device.remove` actions; broader authorization coverage is not implied.
- The legacy generic secret store remains separate from the human Identity credential store and must not be treated as the owner password backend.
- Android performance and live OPA/process claims require server-phone evidence; desktop/source validation alone is insufficient.
- Live browser and long-duration qualification require a running isolated stack and explicit user action.
