</div>

Runbooks are user guidance, not browser shell execution.

- NATS unavailable: verify listener, Tailnet reachability, credentials/config posture, and reconnect evidence.
- Worker consumer stalled: verify durable consumer health and watchdog recovery before restart.
- Agent stopped: verify supervisor, then use explicit recovery.
- Projection stale: preserve last valid state, rebuild prepared projection, and validate revision parity.
- Release verification failed: keep last-known-good PWA and investigate manifest/checksum/health.
