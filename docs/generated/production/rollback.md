# Release rollback

Rollback returns to a previously verified PWA artifact and last-known-good identity.

Do not overwrite evidence. Restore the prior staged artifact atomically, restart only the serving layer that requires it, then verify Caddy, `/health`, `/ready`, release identity, service worker state, and device/app reads.
