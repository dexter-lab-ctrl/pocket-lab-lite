# Security boundaries and redaction

Secrets and raw operational payloads remain backend-only.

The UI and generated artifacts exclude passwords, recovery codes, session credentials, CSRF material, hashes/verifiers, authorization headers, cookies, NATS credentials, Restic passwords, Tailscale auth keys, private keys, raw environment values, OPA input documents, scanner payloads, raw logs, and private Android paths. Human browser writes require an authenticated HttpOnly session plus CSRF header; service API-token authentication remains separate. OPA remains loopback-only and additive to FastAPI-owned hard invariants.
