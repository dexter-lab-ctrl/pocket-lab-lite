# Apps and PhotoPrism

The App Catalog is a backend-owned action surface. PhotoPrism is served through the same-origin `/apps/photoprism/` route when installed and route-ready.

The UI may open the route and request supported actions through FastAPI. It does not run PhotoPrism, PM2, Caddy, storage, backup, repair, or scanner commands directly.
