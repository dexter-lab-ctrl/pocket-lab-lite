# Caddy and same-origin access

Caddy serves the PWA and proxies `/api/lite/*`; app routes such as `/apps/photoprism/*` remain backend-owned and are excluded from PWA fallback capture.

Tailscale HTTPS uses verified Tailnet readiness and protected certificate material. Certificates, private keys, FQDN-specific secrets, and runtime values are never emitted by generated documentation.
