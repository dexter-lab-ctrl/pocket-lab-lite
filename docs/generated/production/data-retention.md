# Data retention

Enrollment, audit, backup, Security, and lifecycle history are retained independently from live connectivity.

Offline devices are not deleted implicitly. Command cleanup cannot remove enrollment. Removal/retirement is explicit, transactional, dependency-aware, and preserves historical audit records. Bounded generated validation evidence follows user retention policy and never enters `dist.zip`.
