# Android and Termux operations

The server-phone runtime is ARM64/Android/Termux and must avoid desktop-only assumptions.

Use Termux-compatible paths and commands, keep generated work bounded, and validate PM2, NATS, Caddy, Tailscale, FastAPI, worker, agent, and supervisor with server-phone evidence. Development browser, Storybook, MkDocs, Redocly, and Allure tooling is not required.
