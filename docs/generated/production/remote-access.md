# Remote access

Tailscale and Caddy provide private same-origin access where configured. The Devices tab shows Tailscale IP only when readiness is verified.

When unavailable, the product says **Remote access not ready**. Startup scripts may safely start `tailscaled`; read APIs remain side-effect free.
