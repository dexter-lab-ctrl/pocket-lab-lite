# Services and PM2

Expected Lite processes include Caddy, FastAPI, NATS/JetStream, worker, node agent, and supervisors; installed apps may add their own managed process.

Use `pm2 status` and bounded process logs for diagnosis. Do not restart healthy services casually; distinguish disconnected, stopped, repairing, and undeliverable-command states.
