# Services and PM2

</div>

Expected Lite processes include Caddy, FastAPI, NATS/JetStream, worker, node agent, supervisors, and the loopback `pocket-opa` policy engine; installed apps may add their own managed process.

Use `pm2 status` and bounded process logs for diagnosis. Validate `pocket-opa` health on loopback before protected mutations. Do not restart healthy services casually; distinguish disconnected, stopped, repairing, policy-unavailable, and undeliverable-command states.
