# Devices and onboarding

<div class="pl-page-meta" markdown>

</div>

Device onboarding is backend-owned: invite creation → audit evidence → copyable bootstrap command → identity guard → safe acceptance → env write → node agent/supervisor start → heartbeats in Devices.

Duplicate names and invites are blocked case-insensitively and separator-insensitively. Identity mismatches fail closed. A lost heartbeat changes a durable enrolled device to Offline/Stale; it does not implicitly delete enrollment.
