# Backup and restore

</div>

Recovery is backend/worker-owned. The UI can request a backup, verification, restore preview, and confirmed restore only through supported FastAPI endpoints.

Restore requires explicit confirmation, a pre-restore checkpoint, and post-restore health validation. Saved-state display never fakes action success.
