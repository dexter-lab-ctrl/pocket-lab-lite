# Security and Safety

</div>

Security checks run through FastAPI, NATS/JetStream, and the worker. Lynis/Trivy output is normalized and sanitized before summary display.

Quick Safety Check is the default low-power profile. Full Local Check and PhotoPrism App Check are explicit deeper checks where enabled. Photos/media, secrets, raw logs, private paths, and raw scanner payloads are excluded from normal UI and generated docs.
