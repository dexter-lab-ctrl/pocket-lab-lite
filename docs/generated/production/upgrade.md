# Upgrade and release verification

An upgrade is valid only when release identity, manifest, artifact checksum, staged PWA contents, and post-switch health agree.

Stable healthy systems use a calm release-check cadence. Manual checks are immediate; active download/apply stages may poll faster only during transition. Auto-apply remains disabled unless explicitly configured and validated.
