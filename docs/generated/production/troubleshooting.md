</div>

Use truthful Lite states before restarting services.

- Running but disconnected: check NATS/Tailscale and reconnect watchdog evidence.
- Agent stopped: verify supervisor and PM2 state.
- Stopped without supervisor: follow recovery guidance; do not fabricate command delivery.
- Security scan accepted but not starting: verify durable consumer health and stale-run recovery evidence.
- Recovery projection stale: inspect freshness/revision and refresh prepared reads; do not treat saved state as fresh.
