# Production architecture

The deployable flow is UI → Caddy → FastAPI → SQLite/NATS → worker/agent/supervisor → sanitized events and prepared reads → UI.

The frontend never talks directly to NATS, executes shell commands, or stores backend secrets. FastAPI is the control API. Agents and supervisors own execution and recovery.
