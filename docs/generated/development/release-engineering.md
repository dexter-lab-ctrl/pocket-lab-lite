# Release engineering

Release qualification is explicit and does not make live, Android, or long-duration checks part of every edit loop.

Run `task lite:check:release` with a running isolated stack and `LITE_E2E_LIVE=1`, then `task lite:release:dry-run`. Artifact validation checks required PWA files, checksum, optional release manifest identity, and forbidden development/state/secret entries.
