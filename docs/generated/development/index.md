# Development documentation

Everything in this section is generated for Ubuntu/WSL2 maintainers. Development tooling is not a production dependency and is not included in `dist.zip`.

## Fast path

```bash
task lite:setup:check
task lite:check:quick
task lite:docs:check
```

The verified WSL2 browser is selected through `task lite:playwright:preflight`; no machine-specific path is committed.
