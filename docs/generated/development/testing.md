The Lite test matrix separates deterministic component/API checks from live read-only integration and explicit device qualification.

- Unit: Vitest and focused backend Pytest.
- Contract: FastAPI OpenAPI export, frontend route usage, generated fixture metadata, Redocly.
- Component: Storybook render and interaction checks.
- Mock integration: Playwright desktop/mobile through MSW and TanStack Query.
- Live integration: read-only Playwright through Caddy/FastAPI when `LITE_E2E_LIVE=1`.
- Device qualification: explicit Android/Termux and long-duration gates only.
