# Validation and release evidence

Lite validation commands write bounded command records under `.pocketlab-dev/validation`; `task lite:allure` converts those records into Allure-compatible JSON without adding a production dependency.

## Release artifact contract

- `dist.zip` contains only the PWA output.
- `checksums.txt` must match `dist.zip`.
- `pocketlab-lite-release.json`, when present, must identify product, release tag, source commit, target, and artifact digest.
- Storybook, MkDocs, Redocly, Playwright, Allure results, state databases, and secrets are excluded.
