SQLite store modules are the source for durable enrollment, Security, Recovery, command lifecycle, and prepared read behavior.

## Store and migration sources

- `pocket-lab-final-structure/runtime/api_fastapi/services/lite_control_plane_store.py`
- `pocket-lab-final-structure/runtime/api_fastapi/services/lite_device_fact_store_extension.py`
- `pocket-lab-final-structure/runtime/api_fastapi/services/lite_restore_transaction.py`
- `pocket-lab-final-structure/runtime/api_fastapi/services/lite_security_store.py`
- `pocket-lab-final-structure/runtime/api_fastapi/services/runtime_snapshot_store.py`

Prepared projection documentation must distinguish scheduler generation, committed generation, canonical hash, freshness, read degradation, and cache state.
