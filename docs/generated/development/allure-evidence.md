# Validation and Allure-compatible evidence

Every recorded gate includes command, commit, platform, start/end timestamps, exit code, result, bounded output, and artifact paths.

`task lite:validation:evidence` generates `allure-results/`, a validation manifest, readiness matrix, and test artifact index. `task lite:allure` also creates a bounded local HTML evidence index. The upstream Allure UI is optional and must use an independently provisioned pinned CLI; it is not a server-phone dependency.
