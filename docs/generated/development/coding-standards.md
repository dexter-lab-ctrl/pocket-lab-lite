# Coding and architecture standards

Changes must preserve Android/Termux, ARM64, low-power, same-origin, and backend-owned execution boundaries.

- Frontend code never executes shell commands or connects directly to NATS.
- FastAPI remains the control API; workers, agents, and supervisors own execution and recovery.
- Safe read caches never store secrets, raw logs, invite tokens, bootstrap secrets, or write responses.
- Generated files must be deterministic, bounded, sanitized, and source-fingerprinted.
- Identity and Rules behavior is not claimed beyond verified source contracts.
