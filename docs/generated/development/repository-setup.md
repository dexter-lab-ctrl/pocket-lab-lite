# Repository and WSL2 setup

Development runs from the Linux filesystem under WSL2. Repository setup restores the committed lockfiles and does not search for or install newer tool versions.

```bash
cd ~/pocket-lab-lite
task lite:setup
task lite:setup:check
```

The setup task reuses the existing `.venv`, runs `npm ci` only when `node_modules` is absent, skips Playwright browser downloads, and installs Python requirements only when imports are missing.
