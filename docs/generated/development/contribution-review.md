# Contribution and review

Keep changes targeted and main clean.

Before review: run quick/full gates as appropriate, generated contract/docs drift checks, `git diff --check`, and generated-artifact cleanup. Do not commit `.orig`, `.rej`, `.pytest_cache`, raw HAR, accidental `dist`, Storybook static output, Allure output, state databases, or secrets.
