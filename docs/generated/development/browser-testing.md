# Playwright and browser resolution

WSL2 browser selection is a first-class preflight. The resolver checks explicit environment variables before auto-detecting `/usr/bin/google-chrome`; CI may use a verified Playwright-managed browser.

## Projects

- mocked-desktop
- mocked-mobile
- live-desktop
- live-mobile

## Evidence

`.pocketlab-dev/validation/playwright-browser.json` records the actual executable, version, launch mode, and WSL detection. Raw HAR files are ignored; only sanitized HAR output may be retained.
