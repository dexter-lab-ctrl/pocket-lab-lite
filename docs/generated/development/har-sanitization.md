# HAR capture and sanitization

Raw HAR files are transient and ignored. Only sanitized HAR output may be retained as evidence.

`task lite:har:sanitize INPUT=<raw.har> OUTPUT=<safe.har>` removes authorization, cookies, credentials, NATS user info, Restic/Tailscale secrets, private keys, and sensitive query/header fields. `task lite:har:inspect` reports failed or duplicate Lite requests and heavy first-paint responses.
